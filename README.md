# Remple

Remple is a very simple resume template built for jekyll. Here is a [demo](https://tahanima.github.io/remple/).

## Installation
Prerequisite: Knowledge of Github and Markdown Syntax

**Step 1**
* Fork the repository. 
* [Optional] You can change the repository name from **Settings** > **Options** > **Repository name**.

**Step 2**
* Edit the **_config.yml file**.
* Change the values for **title**, **description**, **email**, **linkedin**, **github**, **website** and **medium** with your credentials. 
* If you have changed your repository name from ***remple*** to your preferred name, you need to change the value for **baseurl** from ***"/remple/"*** to ***"/[your preferred name]/"***.

**Step 3**
* Edit the **index.md** file with your credentials.

**Step 4**
* Delete the **my-photo.jpg** file.
* Upload your image file, making sure to name it as **my-photo.jpg**. If you want to name your image file to your preferred name or the file extension to your image file is different, then you need to change the value for **photo_url** in the **_config.yml** file to your preferred name or with correct file extension as well.

**Step 5**
* Activate **GitHub Pages** for this site from **Settings** > **Options** > **GitHub Pages**.
* Choose **master** as the source branch and **/ (root)** as the folder.
* You can then access your site at ***[github_user_name].github.io/[repo_name]/***
* Note: **repo_name** is **remple** if you have not changed your repository name otherwise it is your preferred name.
